    Analyze the attached satellite image of a property with these specific steps:

    1. Residence identification: Locate the primary residence on the property by looking for:
       - The largest roofed structure 
       - Typical residential features (driveway connection, regular geometry)
       - Distinction from other structures (garages, sheds, pools)
       Describe the residence's location relative to property boundaries and other features.

    2. Tree overhang analysis: Examine all trees near the primary residence:
       - Identify any trees whose canopy extends directly over any portion of the roof
       - Estimate the percentage of roof covered by overhanging branches (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%)
       - Note particularly dense areas of overhang

    3. Fire risk assessment: For any overhanging trees, evaluate:
       - Potential wildfire vulnerability (ember catch points, continuous fuel paths to structure)
       - Proximity to chimneys, vents, or other roof openings if visible
       - Areas where branches create a "bridge" between wildland vegetation and the structure
   
    4. Defensible space identification: Assess the property's overall vegetative structure:
       - Identify if trees connect to form a continuous canopy over or near the home
       - Note any obvious fuel ladders (vegetation that can carry fire from ground to tree to roof)

    5. Fire risk rating: Based on your analysis, assign a Fire Risk Rating from 1-4:
       - Rating 1 (Low Risk): No tree branches overhanging the roof, good defensible space around the structure
       - Rating 2 (Moderate Risk): Minimal overhang (<25% of roof), some separation between tree canopies
       - Rating 3 (High Risk): Significant overhang (25-50% of roof), connected tree canopies, multiple points of vulnerability
       - Rating 4 (Severe Risk): Extensive overhang (>50% of roof), dense vegetation against structure, numerous ember catch points, limited defensible space

    For each item above (1-5), write one sentence summarizing your findings, with your final response being the numeric Fire Risk Rating (1-4) with a brief justification.
